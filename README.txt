Western Astrology Program

Overview
The Western Astrology Program** is an interactive Python application that determines the user's zodiac sign based on their birthdate. It then provides a brief summary of the sign's characteristics and a link to read more about the sign. This project aims to introduce users to the Western astrological system in an engaging and informative way.

Features
- Calculates the user's zodiac sign based on their birth day and month.
- Provides a personalized 4-line summary of the user's zodiac sign.
- Includes a link to further reading on the user's zodiac sign.
- Easy to use, with error handling for invalid inputs.

How it Works
1. The user inputs their birth day and month.
2. The program uses this information to determine their zodiac sign from a predefined list of zodiac signs and date ranges.
3. The program then displays:
   - The user's zodiac sign.
   - A short summary of the sign's personality traits.
   - A link for the user to explore their zodiac sign in more detail.

Installation and Setup

     ```
   - Or you can download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

2. Install Python (if not already installed):
   - You need Python 3.x to run the program. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Run the Program:
   - Once Python is installed, navigate to the directory where the program is saved.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
